The sun was just starting to set over the horizon when Sarah arrived at the beach. She had been looking forward to this moment for weeks and couldn't wait to feel the sand between her toes and the salty ocean breeze on her face. As she walked towards the water, she noticed a group of children building sandcastles and playing frisbee. Their laughter and energy were infectious, and Sarah couldn't help but smile.
After taking a quick dip in the ocean, Sarah decided to take a walk along the shoreline. She loved the feeling of the cool water lapping at her feet as she strolled along the beach. As she walked, she noticed a few seashells and picked them up to add to her collection. It was moments like these that made her feel grateful to be alive.
As the sun disappeared below the horizon, Sarah knew it was time to head back home. She took one last look at the ocean, feeling content and at peace.
